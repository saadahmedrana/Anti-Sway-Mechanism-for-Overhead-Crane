%% Inverted Pendulum with Animation
% This example shows how to use Simulink(R) to model and animate an
% inverted pendulum system. An inverted pendulum has its center of mass
% above its pivot point. To stably maintain this position, the system
% implements control logic to move the pivot point below the center-of mass
% as the pendulum starts to fall. The inverted pendulum is a classic
% dynamics problem used to test control strategies.

%
% In this example, the system consists of an inverted pendulum mounted to a
% mobile cart. The model constrains the motion to the vertical plane. To
% maintain the system stability, the model implements state feedback
% control to track the cart position.

%% Animation
% The model uses a Level-2 MATLAB S-Function block to implement
% the animation. The S-function uses MATLAB(R) Handle Graphics(R).
% To view the S-function, open |<matlab:open('pendan.m') pendan.m>|. 
set_param('penddemo','StopTime','20');
sim('penddemo');
% In the Pendulum Animation window, use the slider bar to move the pendulum
% pivot point on the cart. To maintain the system stability, the model
% implements observer-based state feedback control.
%% Inverted Pendulum Dynamics
% The model uses a masked subsystem to implement the inverted pendulum
% nonlinear system dynamics. The subsystem determines the cart position
% along the _x_ -axis and the pendulum rotation about the pivot point.
open_system('penddemo/Pendulum','force')
% In the mask, you can enter inverted pendulum parameters, including
% masses, pendulum length, and gravitational acceleration.
%% State Feedback Control
% The model implements state feedback control to track the position of the
% cart and maintain the pivot point below the pendulum center of mass. The
% |State Estimator| subsystem uses a Luenberger observer model to estimate
% the internal states of the system.
%% Analysis
% The Scope block provides signal output as the simulation runs. You can
% also use the Simulation Data Inspector to investigate the logged signals.
